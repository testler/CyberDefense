# Cyber Defense
An interactive educational game on basic cyber defense concepts and strategies

## Summary
This web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to educate users on basic cyber defense concepts and strategies through an interactive tower defense game. Agile development methodologies were used throughout the project, with Git and GitHub for version control. The game focuses heavily on JavaScript to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. The project was a great opportunity to develop my skills in front-end development, problem-solving, and teamwork. The current version includes one level, but the goal is to expand to a total of 10 levels.
