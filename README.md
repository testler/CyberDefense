# CyberDefense
An educational tower defense game

## Summary
This web application only uses HTML, CSS, and basic javascript.  No modules or extensions.  It is still in development, but the end goal is to create an interactive game where people can learn about Cyber security.  This program was a challenge to push the limits of my understanding and abilities.  Users can only complete one level, but I aim to create a total of 10 levels.
