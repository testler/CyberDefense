## Overview

**Cyber Defense** is a modern, educational tower defense game themed around real-world cybersecurity. Defend your Main Server from waves of digital threats—like Viruses, Worms, Ransomware, and DDoS attacks—by deploying cybersecurity tools (Firewall, Antivirus, IDS, Encryption, Honeypot) as towers. Each tool and threat is based on real concepts, and the game teaches players about their roles in digital defense.
